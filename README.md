# FUTURE_INTERN_DS_01
✨ I’m excited to share my E-Commerce Sales Dashboard project built in Power BI!

For this project, I used a real-world sales dataset downloaded from Kaggle to analyze three years of e-commerce transactions. My goal was to turn raw data into meaningful insights that show sales trends, top products, key customers, and regional performance — all in one interactive dashboard.

📊 Key Highlights:

💰 Total Sales: ₹1.90M+

📦 Total Orders: 607+

🏆 Identified top-selling products and loyal customers

🌍 Sales breakdown by country and region

🔍 Easy-to-use filters for deeper analysis


This project really helped me practice working with raw CSV data, transforming it, and visualizing it clearly for business insights.

🛠 Tools Used:
Power BI Desktop | Data cleaning and transformation | Slicers | Cards | Bar and pie charts

I’m grateful to Future Interns for guiding me through this task — it’s been a great experience to learn how to turn data into stories that make sense. 📈✨
